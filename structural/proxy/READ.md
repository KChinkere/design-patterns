<h1>Proxy Design Pattern</h1>
The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that involves creating a surrogate or placeholder object to control access to another object. It provides an intermediary layer between a client and the actual object, allowing for additional operations to be performed before or after the request is passed to the real object.

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>

1. ***Subject:***
    : Defines the interface that both the RealSubject and Proxy implement. It declares the methods that the Proxy and RealSubject share.

2. ***Real Subject:***
    : The actual object that performs the real operations. It implements the Subject interface and contains the core business logic.

3. ***Proxy:***
    : Implements the Subject interface and holds a reference to the RealSubject. It can perform additional tasks such as lazy initialization, access control, or caching before delegating requests to the RealSubject.

<h2>Intent </h2>
- ***Control Access:*** Manage access to the RealSubject, such as adding security checks.


- ***Enhance Functionality:*** Add additional functionality before or after the real objectâ€™s operations.


- ***Optimize Performance:*** Implement lazy initialization or caching to improve performance and resource management.


<h2>Why Use the Proxy Pattern</h2>
1. ***Resource Management:*** When creating an object is resource-intensive or time-consuming, a proxy can delay its creation until it's actually needed (virtual proxy).
2. ***Security:*** To control access to an object by enforcing security checks or access permissions (protection proxy).
3. ***Performance Improvement:*** By caching results of expensive operations to avoid redundant computations (cache proxy).
4. ***Remote Communication:*** To represent an object in a different address space and manage communication with it (remote proxy).


<h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
1. ***Virtual Proxy:*** A web browser that displays a placeholder image while loading the full-size image in the background. The proxy image is used until the real image is loaded.

2. ***Protection Proxy:*** A banking system where access to certain account operations is restricted based on user roles. The proxy enforces access control rules.

3. ***Cache Proxy:*** A database query system where frequently requested data is cached by the proxy to avoid repeated database queries and improve response time.

4. ***Remote Proxy:*** A distributed system where a client interacts with an object located on a remote server. The proxy handles the communication between the client and the server.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The Proxy Design Pattern is a powerful tool for managing access to objects and adding additional functionality without modifying the real object. It helps in controlling resource usage, enhancing security, and improving performance by introducing an intermediary layer. By using proxies, you can design systems that are more flexible and adaptable, allowing for better management of complex interactions and resources.
