<h1>Mediator Design Pattern</h1>
The Mediator Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that facilitates communication between objects by centralizing complex interactions. Instead of objects interacting directly with one another, they send messages through a mediator, which handles the communication and coordination. This reduces dependencies between interacting objects, promoting loose coupling.

<h2>Key Concepts:</h2>

1. ***Mediator:***
    : The mediator defines an interface for communication between components.


2. ***Concrete Mediator:***
    : This class implements the mediator interface and coordinates communication between the objects (colleagues).

 
3. ***Colleagues:***
    : These are the objects that communicate with each other through the mediator. They are aware of the mediator but not of each other’s existence, reducing direct dependencies.

<h2>Intent:</h2>

- ***Reduce coupling between components:***
    : Instead of having components refer to each other directly, they communicate through the mediator.


- ***Centralize control:***
    : The mediator coordinates the interactions between components, often simplifying complex communications.


- ***Enhance maintainability:***
    : Since communication logic is centralized, it's easier to maintain, modify, and extend.


<h2>Why Use the Mediator Pattern:</h2>

- When a system has many objects that need to communicate in a complex way, and you want to avoid a messy, tangled web of dependencies.


- When you want to control how objects communicate with each other by encapsulating the interactions in a mediator.


- When a system is subject to frequent changes in how objects interact, and you need a centralized place to manage these interactions.

<h2>Real-World Examples:</h2>

- ***Chat Applications:***
    : In a group chat, the chat server (mediator) handles messages sent between users. Users don’t need to know about other users, just the chat server.


- ***Air Traffic Control:***
    : Planes (colleagues) don’t communicate with each other directly but instead send their requests (like landing or taking off) to the control tower (mediator).


- ***UI Dialogs:***
  : A form with multiple input fields might communicate changes through a mediator (such as enabling/disabling buttons based on input validation).


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The Mediator Design Pattern is ideal for simplifying interactions between multiple objects by introducing a mediator that handles communication. This reduces the number of direct dependencies between objects, making the system more modular and maintainable. It is particularly useful when objects need to interact in complex ways, or when you want to centralize communication logic for better control and flexibility.
