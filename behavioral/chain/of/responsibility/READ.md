<h1>Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern</h1>
The Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one of them handles the request. Each handler in the chain either processes the request or passes it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern promotes loose coupling and allows requests to be handled dynamically by various objects without knowing which object handles them.

<h2>Key Concepts:</h2>

1. ***Handler:***
    : This is an interface or abstract class that declares a method to process requests and holds a reference to the next handler in the chain. 

2. ***Concrete Handlers:***
    : These classes implement the handler and decide whether they can process the request. If they can, they handle it; if not, they pass it to the next handler.

3. ***Client:***
    : The client sends a request to the chain of handlers. The client does not need to know which handler will handle the request.

<h2>Intent:</h2>

- ***Decouple request senders from receivers:***
    : The sender of a request is not tied to a specific handler.

- ***Allow multiple objects to handle a request:***
    : Each handler has the opportunity to process the request or pass it along the chain.

- ***Promote flexibility:***
    : New handlers can be added to the chain without affecting the client code.

<h2>Why Use the Chain of Responsibility Pattern:</h2>

- When multiple objects might handle a request and the specific handler is not known in advance.


- To dynamically assign responsibility to different objects at runtime.


- To decouple request processing from request sending by using different handlers.


<h2>Real-World Examples:</h2>

1. ***Technical Support System:***
    : A support request might be handled by Level 1 support. If they can't solve it, the request is passed to Level 2, and so on until the issue is resolved.

2. ***Event Handling Systems:***
    : In GUI systems, events such as clicks or key presses are passed through different handlers until they are processed.

3. ***Authorization Systems:***
    : Different layers of authorization (user roles, permissions) can check whether a user has access to a resource. If the first layer cannot decide, the request is passed up the chain.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is useful for scenarios where a request may be handled by multiple objects, each of which has the chance to process or pass the request. It promotes loose coupling and provides flexibility in how requests are handled, as the client only needs to interact with the chain, not individual handlers.
