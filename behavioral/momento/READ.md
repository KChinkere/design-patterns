<h1>Memento Design Pattern</h1>
The Memento Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to save its state so it can be restored to that state later. This pattern is useful when you want to provide undo functionality or simply store historical states of an object without violating its encapsulation.


<h2>Key components</h2>

1. ***Originator:***
    : The object whose state you want to save.

2. ***Memento:***
    : The object that stores the saved state of the originator.

3. ***Caretaker:***
    : The object that is responsible for keeping track of memento(s) but doesn’t modify their content.

<h2>Key Concepts:</h2>

1. ***Encapsulation Preservation:***
    : The state of an object is saved and restored without exposing its internal details to other objects.


2. ***Undo/Redo Support:***
    : By storing previous states in mementos, you can implement undo/redo functionality.
 
 
3. ***Snapshot Mechanism:***
    : The memento acts as a snapshot of the originator's state at a particular moment in time.
 
 
<h2>Intent:</h2>

-  ***Capture and externalize an object’s internal state:***
    : So that it can be restored later without violating encapsulation.

  
- ***Allow undo/redo operations:*** 
    : By maintaining history through saved mementos.
 

- ***Separate concerns:***
    : The object (originator) is responsible for creating a memento (snapshot), and the caretaker is responsible for storing and restoring those snapshots.


<h2>Why Use the Memento Pattern:</h2>
- When you need to save and restore the state of an object at different points in time.


- When you need to implement undo/redo functionality, like in text editors, where users can roll back changes.


- When you want to maintain a history of states without exposing the internal structure of the object.


<h2>Real-World Examples:</h2>

- ***Text Editors:***
    : A common use of the Memento pattern is in text editors where you can undo/redo changes.

- ***State Machines:***
    : In certain games or simulations, you might want to save the current state so you can restore it later (e.g., checkpoint saving).

- ***Transactional Operations:***
    : In database systems, you might store a state before making changes to a system to roll back to that state in case something goes wrong.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The Memento Design Pattern allows an object to save its state without exposing its internal details, enabling features like undo/redo. It encapsulates the state in a memento object, which is managed by a caretaker responsible for saving and restoring states. This pattern is especially useful when you need to implement history management or rollback features in applications, such as text editors, games, or transactional systems.
