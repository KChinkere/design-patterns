<h1>Strategy Design Pattern</h1>

The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm in a separate class, and makes them interchangeable. The strategy pattern allows clients to choose which algorithm to use at runtime without altering the client code. This pattern is useful when there are multiple ways to perform an operation, and you want to allow the client to select the most appropriate algorithm dynamically.


<h2>Key Concepts:</h2>

1. ***Strategy:***
    : Defines an interface common to all supported algorithms. Each concrete strategy implements this interface.


2. ***Context:***
    : Contains a reference to a strategy object. The context delegates execution to the strategy selected by the client.


3. ***Interchangeability:***
    : The strategies can be swapped without changing the code of the context.


<h2>Intent</h2>

- Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable.


- Encapsulate each algorithm within its own class.


- Allow clients to select an algorithm at runtime, enabling flexibility and reducing the need for conditional logic.


<h2>Why Use the Strategy Pattern:</h2>

- When you have different ways of performing an operation, and you want the flexibility to choose or change the algorithm at runtime.


- When a class has multiple conditional branches that depend on various factors. Instead of using multiple ***if-else*** or ***switch statements,*** the strategy pattern delegates the logic to different strategy classes.


- To make the system more extensible and easy to maintain. Adding new algorithms only requires creating a new strategy class without modifying existing code.


<h2>Real-World Examples:</h2>

1. ***Payment Systems:***
    : In an e-commerce system, you can have multiple payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.). The strategy pattern allows you to select the desired payment method at runtime.
 

2. ***Sorting Algorithms:***
    : An application may support multiple sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort, etc.) that can be selected based on the input size or other factors.

3. ***Compression Algorithms:***
    : Applications that need to compress data may offer different compression strategies (e.g., zip, gzip, etc.), allowing clients to choose the compression method.



<h2>Benefits of the Strategy Pattern:</h2>


1. ***Flexibility:*** The client can choose from a variety of strategies and change them at runtime.
2. ***Avoids Conditional Logic:*** Instead of having multiple if-else or switch statements to handle different payment methods, each method is encapsulated in its own class.
3. ***Open-Closed Principle:*** New payment methods can be added without modifying existing code, adhering to the open-closed principle.
4. ***Re-usability:*** Each strategy is encapsulated in a separate class, promoting reuse in different contexts.


<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
The Strategy Design Pattern provides a flexible way to define and encapsulate different algorithms or behaviors within their own classes. By allowing clients to choose between various strategies at runtime, it promotes code reusability and avoids complex conditional logic. This pattern is commonly used in scenarios where different ways of executing a task are needed, and the decision on which one to use should be made dynamically. It makes the system more maintainable and extensible as new strategies can be added without modifying the existing code.
